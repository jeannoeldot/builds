Re: ABS doesn't contain all packages

Just use svn.  Here are the aliases I use (adjust /scratch to a temp dir of your choice):

For core and extra:

getpkg () {
        if [[ -z "$1" ]]
        then
                echo "Supply a package name and try again."
        else
                cd /scratch
                [[ -d "/scratch/packages/$1" ]] && rm -rf "/scratch/packages/$1"
                svn checkout --depth=empty svn://svn.archlinux.org/packages && cd packages
                svn update "$1" && cd "$1"
        fi
}

For community:

getpkgc () {
        if [[ -z "$1" ]]
        then
                echo "Supply a package name and try again."
        else
                cd /scratch
                [[ -d "/scratch/packages/$1" ]] && rm -rf "/scratch/packages/$1"
                svn checkout --depth=empty svn://svn.archlinux.org/community && cd community
                svn update "$1" && cd "$1"
        fi
}
