[arch-dev-public] archbuild: building in a chroot for the lazy

Hi all,

atm every dev has his own scripts or he just doesn't build his packages
in a chroot. Even though mkarchroot and makechrootpkg exist they are
not straight forward to use and you need to configure your chroot
properly.

My long term goal is to create easy to use tools which will use the
exact same build environment for everyone. The first attempt is now in
testing with devtool-0.9.9.

In short: All you need to do now is run e.g. extra-i686-build,
testing-x86_64-build, staging-i686-build etc.. This will do all the
boring work for you like creating the correct chroot etc..

In more detail:
* By default the script will create the chroots in /var/tmp/archbuild.
  Make sure you have enough disk space here. You might use another dir
  by using the -r switch.
* The -c switch will recreate the chroot even if it already exists.
* You can also build i686 pacakges on x86_64.
* TUs can use extra-*-build and testing-*-build to build packages for
  community or community-testing.
* You user will need the permission to use sudo
* Set PACKAGER, MAKEFLAGS, SRCDEST, PKGDEST in your ~/.makepkg.conf
* the first enabled mirror in your mirrorlist will be used for the
  chroots; local mirrors using file:// are supported.

This is in early stage and far from ready. So feedback and feature
request are more than welcome.

Greetings,

Pierre
