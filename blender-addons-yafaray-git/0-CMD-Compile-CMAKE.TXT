_Mo_, yes there is but be warned, the build system changed
and i've had no time to write the building instructions,
scons was replaced by cmake, so if you have time to experiment these are the links:
YafaRay: http://github.com/DarkTide/YafaRay
Blender 2.49b exporter: http://github.com/DarkTide/YafaRay_Blender-2.49
simply hit the button that says "download sources" and remember this is in active development
if you want help configuring the build and running it,
condar or wizofboz may help you on irc, or me if i'm available

Best regards,
DarkTide

OK, if anyone is interested how to build Yafaray beta themselves (on Linux, at least) is as follows:

- apart from the standard dependencies from before, you must have installed 'make' and 'cmake'.

- download the packages listed by DarkTide and put them somewhere.

- in the folder where you unpacked the yafaray sources (not the exporter)
create a directory named build (or whatever).
The binary files will be created in this directory,
so they can be easily deleted afterwards and don't clutter the directory where the sources are.

- go in the build directory and issue cmake ../
This will configure all the options & paths for the building
(it's an replacement for make's ./configure command).

- now from the same directory issue a make command,
that will build the binaries and then a sudo make install that will install them.

- now copy everything 
from <path where you unpacked yafaray sources>/bindings/python and every file in the Blender exporter package,
to <path where you have Blender>/.blender/scripts/yafaray/.
Delete (or archive somewhere) everything in the .blender/scripts/yafaray, before doing this.

- you can issue a make clean, to cleanup all the created files.

I don't know what help for configuring is needed, but I don't know much about writing makefiles and "stuff" :D

EDIT: lol, I probably misunderstood that, I thought that I could help... :lol:
