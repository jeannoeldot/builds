Just in case it can help, I also made a script [0] that updates the
svn tree from alderaan to a local tree and rsync the remote packages
to a local folder.

I then just need to install, test and if OK I can "extrapkg
'blahblahblah'"  from my local machine.

It also works with community packages.

(Don't forget the configuration file [1] if you want to test)
