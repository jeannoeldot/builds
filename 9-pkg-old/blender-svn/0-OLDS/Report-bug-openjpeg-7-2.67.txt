Following the change openjpeg version (1.5.0 -> 1.5.1), cmake does not detect the file openjpeg.h.
Extract from the compilation :
...
-- Could NOT find OpenJPEG (missing:  OPENJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR) 
...
   * WITH_IMAGE_OPENJPEG        OFF
...

By adding this line in the PKGBUILD:
        -DOPENJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/openjpeg-1.5 \

cmake can detect openjpeg.h file, and blender is compiled with support openjpeg.

Just a little note: there are two calls to make in the build() function :
  make $MAKEFLAGS

  make
