options (array)
           This array allows you to override some of makepkg’s default behavior when
           building packages. To set an option, just include the option name in the
           options array. To reverse the default behavior, place an “!” at the front of
           the option. Only specify the options you specifically want to override, the
           rest will be taken from linkman:makepkg.conf[5].  NOTE: force is a special
           option only used in a linkman:PKGBUILD[5], do not use it unless you know
           what you are doing.

           strip
               Strip symbols from binaries and libraries. If you frequently use a
               debugger on programs or libraries, it may be helpful to disable this
               option.

           docs
               Save doc and info directories. If you wish to delete doc and info
               directories, specify !docs in the array.

           libtool
               Leave libtool (.la) files in packages. Specify !libtool to remove them.

           emptydirs
               Leave empty directories in packages.

           zipman
               Compress man pages with gzip.

           ccache
               Allow the use of ccache during build. More useful in its negative form
               !ccache with select packages that have problems building with ccache.

           distcc
               Allow the use of distcc during build. More useful in its negative form
               !distcc with select packages that have problems building with distcc.

           makeflags
               Allow the use of user-specific makeflags during build as specified in
               linkman:makepkg.conf[5]. More useful in its negative form !makeflags
               with select packages that have problems building with custom makeflags
               such as -j2 (or higher).

           force
               Force the package to be upgraded by a pacman system upgrade operation,
               even if the version number would normally not trigger such an upgrade.
               This is useful when the version numbering scheme of a package changes
               (or is alphanumeric). See linkman:pacman[8] for more infomation on
               version comparisons.
